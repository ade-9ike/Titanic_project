## Overview

This project aims to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on a variety of features such as age, gender, class, and more. The sinking of the Titanic in 1912 is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history, and this dataset provides an opportunity to apply data science techniques to gain insights and build predictive models.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) from Kaggle, which includes information about passengers on board the Titanic, such as their age, gender, class, cabin, and whether they survived or not.


## Model Selection

In this project, we have experimented with various machine learning models, including:

Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the best-performing model is selected for final predictions.

## Results
After model selection and fine-tuning, the chosen model achieved an accuracy of 80% on the test dataset. The model can now be used to predict whether a passenger survived the Titanic disaster based on their characteristics.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to predict passenger survival in the Titanic disaster. The chosen model provides a reliable means of making predictions based on passenger information. Further improvements and refinements can be explored to enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.
